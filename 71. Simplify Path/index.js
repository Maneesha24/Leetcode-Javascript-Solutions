 * Given an absolute path for a Unix-style file system, which begins with a slash '/', transform this path into its simplified canonical path.
 * In Unix-style file system context, a single period '.' signifies the current directory, a double period ".." denotes moving up one directory level,
 * and multiple slashes such as "//" are interpreted as a single slash. In this problem, treat sequences of periods not covered by the previous rules
 * (like "...") as valid names for files or directories. The simplified canonical path should adhere to the following rules:
 * It must start with a single slash '/'
 * Directories within the path should be separated by only one slash '/'
 * It should not end with a slash '/', unless it's the root directory
 * It should exclude any single or double periods used to denote current or parent directories
 * Return the new path.
 * @param {string} path
 * @return {string}
